For each execution environment , you can compatable JRE version installed in you machine , you can check one of that and that will be added to JRE system library in workspace .. Now im slecting javaSE-13 and Java 13 not installed in my machine , since I slected Java 14.01.1 and workspace system library points to that

Or else from radio button we can directly select  installed JRE version

By Default STS also comes with its own JRE we need to add that JRE path to workspace to make it available to STS
